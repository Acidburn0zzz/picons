In picons.sh you should keep the following formatting:


# 3 sat
ln -s 3sat.png 1_0_1_6d67_437_1_c00000_0_0_0.png


The channel name contains no spaces or other strange symbols and no capital letters.
Time sharing channels are seperated by a "_".
Channels from Sky... contain a uk/de/it at the end, to keep them apart.
The serviceref may contain capital letters, they are converted to all capital letters when building.
The extension should always be in small letters.
The channel order is "almost" sorted A-Z.


The logos should all be in the resolution 256x154 and properly aligned + the highest quality possible.
